# Lock backpack
## General
Adds the ability to players to lock their backpacks. CBA is required and this script has support for ACE interaction menu and ACE medical.

## Features
Locks carried backpack for anyone that is not the carrier.\
Backpack lock is removed once the backpack is dropped.\
(ACE medical only) Others can open the backpack if the carrier is knocked out.

## Requirements
The only additional requirement is CBA for this script to work properly.

## Installation and configuration:
This is a mission script, you need to implement it into your mission. First copy paste the `scripts` folder into your mission then implement the missing additions in your description.ext. That is it.\
The included mission is just an example!
